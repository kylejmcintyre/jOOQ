/**
 * This type is used for the {@link Select}'s DSL API when selecting generic

 * <p>
 * Example: <code><pre>
 * -- get all authors' first and last names, and the number
 * -- of books they've written in German, if they have written
 * -- more than five books in German in the last three years
 * -- (from 2011), and sort those authors by last names
 * -- limiting results to the second and third row
 *
 *   SELECT T_AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME, T_AUTHOR.LAST_NAME, COUNT(*)
 *     FROM T_AUTHOR
 *     JOIN T_BOOK ON T_AUTHOR.ID = T_BOOK.AUTHOR_ID
 *    WHERE T_BOOK.LANGUAGE = 'DE'
 *      AND T_BOOK.PUBLISHED > '2008-01-01'
 * GROUP BY T_AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME, T_AUTHOR.LAST_NAME
 *   HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
 * ORDER BY T_AUTHOR.LAST_NAME ASC NULLS FIRST
 *    LIMIT 2
 *   OFFSET 1
 *      FOR UPDATE
 *       OF FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME
 *       NO WAIT
 * </pre></code> Its equivalent in jOOQ <code><pre>
 * create.select(TAuthor.FIRST_NAME, TAuthor.LAST_NAME, create.count())
 *       .from(T_AUTHOR)
 *       .join(T_BOOK).on(TBook.AUTHOR_ID.equal(TAuthor.ID))
 *       .where(TBook.LANGUAGE.equal("DE"))
 *       .and(TBook.PUBLISHED.greaterThan(parseDate('2008-01-01')))
 *       .groupBy(TAuthor.FIRST_NAME, TAuthor.LAST_NAME)
 *       .having(create.count().greaterThan(5))
 *       .orderBy(TAuthor.LAST_NAME.asc().nullsFirst())
